Monarchs vied for territorial power, religious reformers questioned the central tenets of the church and scholars sought greater understanding of their world. Against this backdrop, artists produced works of extraordinarily diverse subject matter and superb technical skill.\nThis exhibition brings together over 100 works by the greatest Northern European artists of the period.  Among the highlights are prints and drawings by Albrecht Dürer, mythological paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder, and preparatory drawings by Hans Holbein the Younger displayed alongside the finished oil portraits.','509bd571b683019798000048','The Northern Renaissance: Dürer to Holbein',NULL,'5069e2f6b37cf400020006d9',3);

Most images included were made in the 1960s – arguably Colorama’s heyday and a time of great social change in America. We are pleased to share these Coloramas with a new generation of viewers, who, we hope, will respond, not only as Edward Steichen did in 1950, “agog and smiling, all just feeling good,” but with a thought to how these productions shaped a generation, and its ideas about the world. Colorama is a traveling exhibition organized by the George Eastman House.','50e4a778a92d6af2f400010b','Colorama',NULL,'50d32632112cf5a389000422',3);

Created by artists with modern minds like our own, this is a unique opportunity to see the world\'s oldest known sculptures, drawings and portraits.\n\nIce Age art was created between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago and many of the pieces are made of mammoth ivory and reindeer antler. They show skilful, practised artists experimenting with perspectives, scale, volumes, light and movement, as well as seeking knowledge through imagination, abstraction and illusion.\n\nThese exceptional pieces are presented alongside modern works by Moore, Mondrian and Matisse, illustrating the fundamental human desire to communicate and make art as a way of understanding ourselves and our place in the world.\n','51377f5ae04af8d5260000d8','Ice Age Art: arrival of the modern mind',NULL,'5061d93969b33a0002000c17',3);
